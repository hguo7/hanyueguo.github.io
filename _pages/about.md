Hi, Iâ€™m Hanyue Guo ðŸ‘‹

I recently completed my Master of Physics atÂ [Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT)](https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/beijing-institute-technology#p2-university-information), where my research focused on fast radio bursts (FRBs) and their applications in cosmology. I am passionate about cosmology, high-energy astrophysics, and using deep learning techniques in scientific research.

Apart from my research, I have also gained experience as a teaching assistant in physics and actively participated in various summer schools and training programs related to astronomy and data science.

Iâ€™m proficient in Python, familiar with MCMC tools like emcee and CosmoMC, and experienced with deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch. On this GitHub, I share my projects and coding explorations, particularly those involving astrophysical data analysis and machine learning.

Feel free to reach out to me viaÂ emailÂ to discuss potential collaborations or just to chat about science and tech!
